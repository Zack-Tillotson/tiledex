Other Pokémon's Electric moves raise this Pokémon's Special Attack one stage, negating any other effect on it, and cannot miss it.\n\nIf the move's intended target also has this ability, the move is not redirected.  When multiple Pokémon with this ability are possible targets for redirection, the move is redirected to the one with the highest Speed stat, or, in the case of a tie, to a random tied Pokémon.  follow me takes precedence over this ability.\n\nIf the Pokémon is a ground-type and thus immune to Electric moves, its immunity prevents the Special Attack boost.",
