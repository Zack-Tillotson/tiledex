If a Pokémon is asleep and acquires this ability, it will immediately wake up; this includes when regaining a lost ability upon leaving battle.\n\nThis ability functions identically to insomnia in battle.\n\nOverworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, higher-levelled Pokémon have their encounter rate increased.",
