After each battle, this Pokémon has a 10% chance of picking up an item if it is not already holding one.\n\nThe air balloon and eject button cannot be picked up.\n\nThe items that may be found vary by game, and, since Pokémon Emerald, by the Pokémon's level.  This ability is checked after the battle ends, at which point any temporary ability changes have worn off.",
