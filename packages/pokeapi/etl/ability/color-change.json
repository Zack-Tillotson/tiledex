  "description": "Whenever this Pokémon takes damage from a move, the Pokémon's type changes to match the move.\n\nIf the Pokémon has two types, both are overridden.  The Pokémon must directly take damage; for example, moves blocked by a substitute will not trigger this ability, nor will moves that deal damage indirectly, such as spikes.\n\nThis ability takes effect on only the last hit of a multiple-hit attack.\n\nIn Pokémon Colosseum and XD: Gale of Darkness, this ability does not take effect on Shadow-type moves.",
