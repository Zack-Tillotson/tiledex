In a double battle, both opponents are affected.\n\nThis ability also takes effect when acquired during a battle, but will not take effect again if lost and reobtained without leaving battle.\n\nThis ability has no effect on an opponent that has a substitute.\n\nOverworld: If the first Pokémon in the party has this ability, any random encounter with a Pokémon five or more levels lower than it has a 50% chance of being skipped.",
