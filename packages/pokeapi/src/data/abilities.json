This ability cannot ignore multitype at all.\n\nAn ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used.  For example, this Pokémon's moves can paralyze a Pokémon with limber, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon's spikes are not affected by this ability after they have been placed.\n\nWhen this Pokémon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability.\n\nThis ability functions identically to mold breaker and teravolt.",
