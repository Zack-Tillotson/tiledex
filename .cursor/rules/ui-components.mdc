# UI Component Rules

UI components are presentational components that use atomic components and can be client-side.

## Guidelines
- UI components are intended to be simple rendering components with no (or very limited) state.
- Typically will use atomic components from @repo/ui but can also render DOM elements directly
- Must export props interface
- Must have unit tests
- Styles will be implemented in CSS modules
