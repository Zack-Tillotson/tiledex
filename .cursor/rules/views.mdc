# View Component Rules

Views are server components that contain business logic and render UI components, they are meant to be self contained and isolated components which handle data, state, and UI rendering.

## Guidelines
- Must be server components
- No style imports - styles should be included in the UI components
- Must have unit tests and will typically have end-to-end tests; the tests will focus on validating orchestration like prop passing and rendering child components correctly.
- Must be named with 'View' suffix
- Should render UI components
- Must have JSDoc documentation

## Examples

âœ… Good:
```tsx
// views/PokemonView.tsx
export function PokemonView({ id }: { id: string }) {
  const pokemon = usePokemonData(id);
  return (
    <PokemonDetail 
      pokemon={pokemon}
      onFavorite={handleFavorite}
    />
  );
}
```
